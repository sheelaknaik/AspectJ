# AspectJ
AspectJ with Archinamon plugin



AspectJLibrary project is the library with Archinamon plugin
TestFinalwithLibrary is app using the library AspectJLibrary(using aar)
TestWithoutLib is app directly with the library code AspectJLibrary(instead of aar)

With TestWithoutLib project I'm able to capture user UI clicks. However, when library is added it doesn't capture.
